# JavaLite
Java lite is a language that brings the textual constraints to the syntax of the Java language, the language is made in such way that it can be written as a normal text.

# Syntactic analysis #
Consists of two phases Scanning and Parsing, is responsible for evaluating the syntactic rules and producing the intermediate code represented by Abstract Syntax Tree.
## Scanning ##
Scanner (also known as the lexical analyzer): The scanner is responsible for breaking the source code down into a sequence of tokens, which are the basic building blocks of the language. The scanner uses regular expressions or other patterns to identify the tokens in the source code. A token is an atomic, basic unit of a programming language. It is a string of characters that is recognized by the compiler as a single logical entity. Tokens can be classified into different types, such as keywords, identifiers, constants, and operators. Each type of token has a specific meaning and is treated differently by the compiler. In compiler construction, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that describes a pattern of strings. Regular expressions are used to match patterns in input strings and are commonly used in the scanning phase of compiler construction to identify tokens in the source code.

## Parsing ##
The parser is responsible for checking the syntax of the source code, ensuring that it follows the rules of the programming language. It does this by building a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the scanner.
